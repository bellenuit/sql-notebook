# SQL Notebook

Notebooks are applications that mix text and executed code in a printable document. They adhere to the scientific tradition to keep a journal of all experiences.

I needed a notebook that can be installed anywhere and runs SQL code locally. This notebook runs in the webbrowser. You can download it this page as webpage and then it will run the computer and never communicate with a server.

The SQL notebook is a playground where you can explore data. You can import data and run queries on it. You can visualize the data using PostScript. And you can enhance both SQL and PostScript with JavaScript. You can save the notebook as JSON document and reopen it later. The JSON document is self contained, meaning that it contains all the data.
